# Scraping-football-data

This is my python project for the purpose of scripting languages course at the University. The purpose of the project is to scrape some data from the Web and save it on a database. 

I decided to pull some data from ekstraklasa.org, specifically from the result table. The data can be pulled either using regex or with BeautifulSoup library allowing me to extract interesting content out of HTML.
